# Disease_prediction
 Abstract:
⮚ Through analysis of medical data and utilization of diverse machine learning techniques, the
research endeavors to enhance disease prediction accuracy, facilitating personalized patient
care.
⮚ Disease prediction using machine learning techniques has emerged as a promising approach for early
diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment in healthcare.
⮚ The primary objective is to enhance prediction accuracy and facilitate personalized patient care.

 Machine learning algorithms used:
⮚ Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), and Random Forest classifiers.
⮚ Model training is performed using labeled data, and model performance is evaluated using various metrics
such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are employed to assess the
generalization and robustness of the models. A confusion matrix is used to determine the quality of the models.

 Use Cases:
⮚ Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately predicting
disease outcomes and identifying high-risk individuals. Furthermore, the framework facilitates personalized
patient care by providing actionable insights and decision support for clinicians and healthcare providers.

 Claim:
⮚ This project contributes to advancing the field of disease prediction using machine learning by providing a
systematic and scalable framework for leveraging medical data to improve patient outcomes. The proposed
approach has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by enabling early intervention, tailored
treatment strategies, and proactive management of chronic diseases.
